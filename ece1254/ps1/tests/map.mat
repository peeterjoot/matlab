% Can we assume that the netlist file will always have a 0 node?
% 
% If we can't assume that, then we can push all the node numbers into a hash, grab the keys
% and take the min (say), treating that as the ground node.
% 
% Having to nominate a node as ground would add complexity, but not too much.

clear all ;

nodesMap = containers.Map({0}, {0}) ;
nodesMap(1) = 0 ;
nodesMap(2) = 0 ;
nodesMap.remove(0) ;

keys = cell2mat( nodesMap.keys ) ;

disp( min(keys) ) ;

% alternately, could just push all the node numbers onto an array

clear all ;
nodes = [] ;
% 'push' operation can be done with the 'end' index position.
nodes(end+1) = 1 ;
nodes(end+1) = 2 ;

disp( min(nodes) ) ;
